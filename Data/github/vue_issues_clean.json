asset type global method option deprecated configure transition inline component props events create reusable transition effects especially custom javascript hooks well answer creating transition components particularly suitable functional components use like html toggled content vmodel changes params modifiers new modifier trims input name suggests param deprecated see upgrade tip bottom
